      <ul>
        <li>for interested parties, this page discusses the governing philosophy (design and otherwise) of this site: self-identity
        <li>while creating this site, I became interested in the tension between how we advertise ourselves and who we actually are,
          how we can get to know ourselves better, and what that would allow us to do.
        <li>the design and content of this site is the beginning of my answer to these questions.
        <li>without further ado, a loosely organized yak on identity. if you come back later it might just be organized better, but hey,
          we've all got lives to live. anyways:
        <br>
        <br><!--no clue why I need two page breaks here but having just one results in no break at all -->
        <li>i'll be the first to tell you that I'm not an expert on self-identity or identity modeling
        <li>that said, typical models of identity formation focus on:
          <ol>
            <li>identity vs.role confusion (Erikson)
            <li>different identity statuses (Marcia)
            <li>realms of identity exploration (Arnett)
            <li>self-concept with respect to various roles or groupings- including cultural, professional, ethnic, religious, gender, physical, and/or political identities
            <li>interpersonal identity development (again Marcia)
            <li>various influences on identity- cognitive, scholastic, sociocultural, parenting, and cybersocial/internet
          </ol>
        <li>there's a couple decades of work there by probably thousands of psychologists, and I've had a lot of fun perusing the basics
        <br>
        <li>my non-rigorous pet theory is that the perfect identity model would take into account:
          <ol>
            <li>the base state a person is born in (their nature, i.e. heredity, perhaps best captured by their genome)
            <li>the full set of experiences they've had since birth (every interaction they've ever had with anyone, every bit of info they've ever taken in. Every stimuli.
            <li>the full set of actions they've taken since birth (every physical motion, thing they've said, even thought they've had). Every response.
          </ol>
        <br>
        <li>
          depending on your view of agency, one could then construct a model of human behavior that goes something like:
          genome + set of past stimuli/response pairs (i.e. ate donut, liked it) = future responses (i.e. shits, eats more donuts some other time),
          imagining the human as some sort of stimuli filtration device.
        </li>
        <li>
          in the i/o metaphor that inspired this whole line of thinking,
          output is rather neatly a function of input, and I guess the function itself is the /, or me, or you.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>now, obviously, this dataset is completely impossible to collect in full, and hopefully will be for a few centuries-millenia, because it would likely require some sort of mass opt-in surveillance program, which in turn would probably quickly morph into some sort of horrid surveillance state (as the saying goes, with great power comes great opportunity for somebody down the line to fuck everybody else over), and this will (again probably, qualifiers always necessary when making statements about something as chaotic as the future of a globe of living beings) continue to be the case until we can mature emotionally, socioculturally, and probably literally biologically to the point that we're ready for that kind of radical depth of information.</li>
        <br>
        <li>BUT, that doesn't mean we can't get a lot better sense of who we are by creating a record of all our personal experiences, how we've responded to them, and then use that understanding to better inform future i/o decisions.</li>
        <br>
        <li>it's in this spirit that I've decided to embark upon the creation of just such a record, which has resulted in the nascent site that you see before you. i'd be honored to have you along for the ride, and let me know what you think below!</li>
