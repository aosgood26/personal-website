    I had a hell of a time trying to vertically center the nav bar on this page, margin-top/margin-bottom don't seem to work on div's that have the display:table property.
    Also did some experiments with divs and different div classes/properties, which is why there's a separate class for the landing page row/columns.
    Even tried two different complex solutions I found on stackoverflow, but none of it worked. Oh well, it still looks pretty good, just would be better on mobile if I could have done it IMO.
